This project implements a Personality Prediction System using CV analysis. It leverages machine learning techniques to analyze various factors from a candidate's CV, such as gender, age, job experience, and personality traits. The system predicts the candidate's personality based on these inputs, providing insights into their openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. It offers a user-friendly interface where applicants can input their details and upload their CV for analysis. The predicted personality results are displayed along with the parsed information from the CV, providing a comprehensive overview for employers. This project can be a valuable tool for recruitment processes and understanding candidates' personality traits.
